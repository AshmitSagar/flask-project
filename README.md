# flask-project

Fully functional flask driven webapp

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- BootStrap

To run this code

``` python
flask run
```

As was seen in the last lecture we hard coded the html within the python code itself.
This approach is very diffcult to maintain and should be avoided.
Rather we make templates which help us maintain separation between html/css and python code
